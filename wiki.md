Welcome to the leo wiki!

Leo was inspired by the iconic Leonard Bernstein, well known as a master conductor. Having better tools to manage an orchestra won't make you a better conductor or musician, but it will give you more time to play and less time to manage sheet music.

This project is currently in pre-alpha.
